WEATHER STATION APPLICATION

A Java GUI weather application that displays current conditions and hourly forecasts using the Open-Meteo API.


REGARDING THE 'OpenMeteoClient.java' CLASS:

This class was fully provided by my university as part of a coursework assignment. I did not create this component - it was supplied as a pre-built API client to interact with weather data services. My contribution is solely in the GUI implementation (`WeatherApp.java`).


FEATURES:

Current weather display (temperature, precipitation, wind, humidity)
7-Day forecast in tabular format
Location search for global cities
Responsive GUI with scrollable forecast area

USAGE:

Enter a certain location

Click the 'Check Weather' button

Current weather information and forecast data is provided
